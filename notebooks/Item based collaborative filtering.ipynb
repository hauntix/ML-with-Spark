    "- Find every pair of movies that were watch by the same person\n",
    "- Measure the similarity of their ratings across all users who watched both\n",
    "- Sort by movie, then by similarity strength\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making it a spark problem!\n",
    "- map input ratings to (user, (movieID, rating))\n",
    "- find every movie pair rated by the same user\n",
    "    - this can be done with a \"self-join\" operation\n",
    "    - At this point we have (userID, ((movieID1, rating1), (movieID2,rating2)))\n",
    "- Filter out duplicate pairs\n",
    "- Make the movie pairs the key\n",
    "    - map to ((movieID1, movieID2), (rating1, rating2))\n",
    "- groupByKey() to get every rating pair found for each movie pair\n",
    "- Compute similarity between ratings for each movie in the pair\n",
    "- Sort, save, and display the results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using all our pc's cores\n",
    "`sc = SparkContext(\"local[*]\", \"MovieSimilarities\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caching RDD's\n",
    "- In this example, we'll query the final RDD of movie similarities a couple of times\n",
    "- Any time you will perform more than one action on an RDD, you must cache it!\n",
    "- Use .cache() or .persist() to do this.\n",
    "    - Whats the difference?\n",
    "    - Persist() optionally lets you cache it to disk instead of just memory, just in case a node fails or something"
