    "- It is a dark art.\n",
    "- Your master will run a console on port 4040\n",
    "    - But in EMR, its next to impossible to actually connect to it from outside\n",
    "    - If you have your own cluster running on you own network, life's a little easier \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Logs\n",
    "    - In standalone mode, they're in the web UI\n",
    "    - In YARN though, the logs are distributed. You need to collect them after the fact using `yarn logs -applicationID <app id>`\n",
    "- While your driver script runs, it will log errors like executors failing to issue hearbeats\n",
    "    - This generally means you are asking too much of each executor\n",
    "    - You may need more of them - ie, more machines in your cluster\n",
    "    - Each executor may need more memory\n",
    "    - Or use partitionBy() to demand less work from individual executors by using smaller partitions\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Managing Dependencies\n",
    "- Remember you executors aren't necessarily on the same box as your driver script\n",
    "- Use broadcast variables to share data outside of RDD's\n",
    "- Need some Python package that's not pre-loaded on EMR?\n",
    "    - Set up a step in EMR to run pip for what you need on each worker machine\n",
    "    - Or use `-pyfiles` with `spark-submit` to add individual libraries that are on the master\n",
    "    - Try to just avoid using obscure packages you don't need in the first place. Time is money on your cluster, and your better off not fiddling with it."
